# Portfolio
This is probably my third iteration of a personal portfolio,
but instead of making a cool design and hacking together headache inducing animations I've decided to build this portfolio website after some guidelines, focusing on UX:

## Portfolio guidelines
 - Content is king
 - Legibility is queen
 - Clarity
 - Design should be uniform across devices
 - Only web safe fonts
 - Animation; If used at all, used very sparringly and only where it will increase legibility
 - Keep the website small for fast download speeds across different network setups
 - No Javascript 
 - No Images
 - Progressive Disclosure *or Do not create another portfolio SPA* 

## Development
For fast development of this portfolio website I've used 

 - Jade
 - Grunt
 - SASS
